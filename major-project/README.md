## Hadronic cross section for the process $u \bar{d} \rightarrow W^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$

A place to store/track updates I make on my Major Project.

### Build instructions: 
> Run ./commit-push.sh "enter message here" in Terminal (in dir major-project-local/major-project) to upload latest version of MP to the repo.
> - commit-push.sh is essentially a script I wrote to do the usual git add --> git commit --> git push workflow in one call
> - I also added a line where it checks if there is anything to commit (check for changes) and if there isn't then it prints "Nothing to comit" and exits; prevents empty commits. 
>
> There is also an option to run the script inside TeXStudio itself! Just press shift+cmd+c inside TeXStudio, a pop-up should appear that prompts the User to write a message. The User can press OK without entering anything and it commits with no message. 

###  Ignored files:
The following files are ignored in the commit (see `.gitignore`):

- Auxiliary LaTeX files (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.toc`, etc.)
- PDFs (can change to also update but not necessary)
- Build directories
